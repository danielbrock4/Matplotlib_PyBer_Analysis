# Matplotlib_PyBer_Analysis
Matplotlib has a rich set of features for creating and annotating charts that visualize data in a Data Series or DataFrame. Using Matplotlib, I will create line charts, bar charts, scatter plots, bubble charts, pie charts, and box-and-whisker plots, and make them visually compelling and informative by adding titles, axes labels, legends, and custom colors
